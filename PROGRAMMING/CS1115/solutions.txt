1.  (i) article. 
    TAG_A is an <article> tag as it can be distributed independently without any relation to the other elements in the web page

    (ii) h1.
    TAG_B is a <h1> tag as it serves as the title for the article.

    (iii) b.
    TAG_C is a <b> tag as it is drawing the reader's attention to that element.

    (iv) i 
    TAG_D is an <i> tag as "Lord Haw Haw" is a name that is given to mule. i tags often indicate a technical term, phrase from
    a foreign language or a name. In this scenario it is applicable.

    (v) em 
    TAG_E has a certain emphasis on the phrasing of "me".


2.  (i) Wrong order of end tags. The <i> tag should close first then the <h2> tag. This is because the <h2> tag was opened first so it had to be closed last.

    (ii) Inside the attribute href there is no hash symbol (#) used to represent the id attribute. 
    It should have been "<a href="#island">Go to Love Island</a>"

    (iii) 
    <a href="/macnabb.html"><img src="/images/macnabb.jpg" alt="Image of Matthew MacNabb"></a>

    (iv)
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>height</th>
                <th>width</th>
                <th>depth</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>5</td>
                <td colspan="2">4</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td colspan="2" rowspan="2">3</td>
                <td>2</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>1</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

4.  (i) There is no id attribute that correlates to #F within the element h1.
        "id= 'F'" is rather within the ol element with id= 'E'.

    (ii) 'Millie' is of class='female', therefore the "section .female" selector is valid and 
        hence 'Millie' is selected.

    (iii) As li + li matches all li elements that are immediately preceded by sibling li of id='F' (Millie) and li of id='K' (Liam).

    (iv) 8. As the '+' selects every element preceding the initial sibling element the elements selected are 
        <p id="D">, <ol id="E">, <p id="I">, <ol id="J">, <li id="G">, <li id="H">, <li id="L">, <li id="M">

    (v) li 

5.  (i) 
     First we check if there is any conflict. There is not as they are not selecting the same element.
    Therefore it must be the rules of inheritance. The css selector of the tag section makes all all elements 
    within the section green by inheritence. However the ol selector blocks the inheritence and makes the ol elements
    blue therefore 'Teddy' is blue.

    (ii)
     We check if there is conflict. 'Teddy' is of class='male' so it is selected by .male and it is also of id='M' so it 
    is selected by #M. Hence, there is conflict. Origin is not an issue as the conflict is on the same stylesheet. Therefore it must
    be specificity. The more specific rule wins. We check if there is an id being selected. There is (id='M'). Therefore the id 
    selector wins and 'Teddy' is blue as the id selector is most specific.

    (iii)
     We check if there is conflict. 'Teddy' is of class='male' so it is selected by .male and it is also an li so it 
    is selected by the li selector. Hence, there is conflict. Origin is not an issue as the conflict is on the same stylesheet. Therefore it must
    be specificity. The more specific rule wins. We check if there is an id being selected. There is not. The next most specific is class attribute.
    There is a class attribute being selected. Hence class='male' wins and 'Teddy' is blue.

    (iv)
     We check if there is conflict. There isn't. Therefore it must be due to inheritance. The ol selector selects all ol elements and 
    makes them green by inheritance. However the li element blocks the inheritance and makes the li elements blue. Hence 'Teddy' is blue.

    (v)
     We check if there is conflict. There is. Origin is not an issue as the conflict is on the same stylesheet. Therefore it must
    be specificity. The more specific rule wins. We check if there is an id attribute being selected. There is not.
    We check for a class attribute being selected. There is not. Thus we must compare length. The 'section ol li' selector is longer 
    and hence it is more specific. 'Teddy' is therefore blue.
