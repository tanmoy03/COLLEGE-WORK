                    <p>
                        Customers are advised that recent batches of Bray Brie are <em>infested</em> with worms. 
                        Big worms. Worms of the priapulida family. These worms are <em>poisonous.</em>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Do not eat this cheese.</strong> Nor the worms. Return this cheese to your retailer

                    <p>
                        Barry Buttermilk, head cheese-maker at <i>Croom Creamery</i> in County Dublin, 
                        has recently returned from a fact-finding mission to France. 
                        So impressed was he with <i lang="fr">le fromage Français</i> that he intends introducing 
                        French production methods to his factory. 
                        Mostly these methods involve a lot of shrugging and going on strike.

                    <p>
                        Irish cheese exports to Europe are flourishing but there are signs that the 
                        American market is saturated with fat.
